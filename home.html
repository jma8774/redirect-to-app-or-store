  // Problem with no using Universal Links (ios) and App Links (android) is that we can't really detect if the app was actually opened or not
  // therefore the browser will always ask to redirect to the app store, even if the app was opened
  // I tried to get around this by adding a timer of 2 seconds, so all is OK if they open the app within 2 seconds, but if they don't, it will ask to redirect to the app store
  // Also if the app does not exist for this URI scheme, it will display a nasty "Cannot open app" message on Safari (can't do anything about it)

  // If we were to use Universal Links and App Links, we would probably need someone with a Mac to code the universal links part maybe and someone else to work on the android part seperately (I don't have a Mac)
